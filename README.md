# nicelstm
This repository is an adaptation of the NICE model: Nonlinear Independent Components Estimation (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.8516.pdf) pytorch version produced by https://github.com/fmu2/NICE. I tried using NICE for time series data and added an LSTM layer to the model. It works well, but the performance is inferior to other generative models, including NICE itself.
